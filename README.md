## Purpose
---
Word Monster is a game based on the classic 'hangman' game, where the user has to figure out a word by guessing one letter at a time. The game is over when the user has guessed incorrectly 7 times, or when they have revealed the word by guessing all the correct letters. For this version, instead of drawing part of the hangman for each wrong guess, there is a 'monster' character with obstacles between it and the trophy. Each wrong guess erases an obstacle and the monster claims the trophy on the seventh wrong guess. The reason for using this character instead of the classic hangman is to make it a bit more friendly and light-hearted. 

The game is aimed at children as a way of helping them to learn words and how they are spelled, in a fun way. It is also designed to appeal to adults in a nostalgic way, since many played hangman as children and the style of the game is reminiscent of old video games.

####    User’s goals:
- the game's users want to practice their spelling
- they want to improve their vocabulary
- they want to exercise their brain in a fun way
- they want a fun, nostalgic game to divert attention for a few minutes of their day

####    Site owner’s goal:
- the goal of the website is to provide a game for use by children to help with learning the correct spelling of words, and to improve their vocabulary by exposing them to different words in the game. 
- And to provide a game for adults who want to brush up on their spelling and/or vocabulary, or just want to exercise their brain a little bit, or play the game for a few minutes of distraction from daily life.
