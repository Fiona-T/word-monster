                <li>Pick a category: Adjective or Verb</li>
                <li>A word will be chosen at random which you will need to guess!</li>
                <li>The number of dashes: _ shows how many letters are in the word that you need to guess</li>
                <li>Click on one of the letters at the bottom half of the screen to make a guess</li>
                <li>If you guess correctly, the letter will fill the blank space(s) in the word</li>
                <li>If you guess incorrectly, the monster will eat one of the obstacles and get one step closer to the
                    trophy!</li>
                <li>You can keep guessing but for every wrong guess the monster eats another obstacle and after eating
                    six obstacles it gets the trophy!</li>
                <li>You have 7 chances to guess incorrectly</li>
                <li>If you guess all the correct letters before running out of chances, you get the trophy!</li>
                <li>If you need a hint, click on the Hint? button and you will get a short hint to help you guess the
                    word</li>
                <li>The letters you have already guessed are shown in a different colour, so you know not to choose them
                    again.</li>
                <li>The number of trophies you have won, representing the words you have guessed correctly, are shown in
                    the Score at the top of the page.</li>
